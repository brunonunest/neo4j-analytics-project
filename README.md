# Data analyst challenge
You work in a big credit card company and the company is having difficulties retaining customers. Cards cancellations are significantly 
growing! The company directors are now looking for some direction on where to start addressing the issue and find hypothesis for what's triggering these cancellations.

Which customers have a bigger tendency to cancel the card ? Is there any insight/hypothesis we can derive from data? What can we do to avoid more cancellations ?

The only data point we have available is the customer database the finance department extracted with customers who have cancelled and who are still in using the active. 

### Some guidelines
- We recommend the analysis to be python based
- Please explain/document the process of the data analysis you did

### What we'll be looking for
- You're able to analyze the data
- You show critical thinking about what the data tells you
- You can properly communicate the results
